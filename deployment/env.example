# Email Service Configuration
# Choose ONE method: SendGrid (recommended for Render) OR SMTP (for dedicated servers)

# Option 1: SendGrid (Recommended - works on Render and dedicated servers)
# Get your API key from: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
# If SENDGRID_API_KEY is set, the app will use SendGrid instead of SMTP
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_sendgrid_api_key_here

# Option 2: SMTP Configuration (for dedicated servers with SMTP access)
# For Gmail, use smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# Your email credentials
# For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password (not your regular password)
# See README.md for instructions on how to generate a Gmail App Password
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Email address that will send the emails (required for both SendGrid and SMTP)
FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Email address to receive contact form submissions (required)
TO_EMAIL=recipient@example.com
